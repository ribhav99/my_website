                        This is the classic game of Space Invaders that I made during the Summer of 2018.
                        I made the game in python and it was the first game I ever made. I used this as a
                        project to familiarise myself with the language and the documentation
                        of python modules. There really isn't much more to the game than what you can
                        see in the picture on the right. The red sprites are generated randomly and move
                        randomly throughout, having 6 at a time. Once one of them is hit, that sprite is
                        removed and another one is generated randomly. There are always 2 bombs falling
                        downwards and if the player collides with either the one, the game is over. The
                        score is displayed in the top left hand corner of the screen.

                        &emsp;&emsp; UPDATE: Added option for the user to upload a picture to determine body type (using machine learning). More personalised workouts are given based on body type, time availability and goals.
                        &emsp;&emsp; This is an IOS app that I made in the summer of 2018. The inspiration for this
                        app came when one of my friends asked me what he should do for one of his
                        workouts. I remembered all those times that I was just too lazy to do some research
                        and come up with a new workout which is effective as well. So I took out my laptop
                        and wrote a program in python that would create a random workout for whichever muscle
                        group I chose. That lead to the development of the app to make it more convenient for me
                        to use and for my friends to use. Now there are a ton of articles and videos online
                        that could do the same thing. But here's why I felt the need to do this:
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; Every major muscle group, that you would usually train in the gym, has a variety
                        of functions and muscle fibres along different directions that should be trained in
                        a slightly different way to maximise results. I can explain this best using an example.
                        Refer to the pictures shown above. In this example, I chose to do a regular chest workout.
                        Now the chest is divided into three main areas: the upper, middle and lower chest. The chest
                        performs two main movements, namely, pushing movements and adduction of the arms. So to
                        have a wholesome chest workout, one should ideally do exercises for the upper, middle and lower
                        chest as well as exercises that involve adduction of the arms (movement towards each other).
                        <br />
                        What this app does is, it gives you a workout that encapsulates all the functions of that muscle,
                        targeting it in different ways and from different angles to maximise your gains. And since
                        changing your workout routines often helps progress, this app generates a random workout
                        each time while keeping the essential functionalities that should be performed.
                        <br />
                        Another important feature to note, is that when this app incorporates super-sets (see pictures
                        above), it makes sure that the area of the muscle targeted in the exercises is different, so as
                        to avoid doing a drop set instead of a super-set. In the example above, you can see that the first
                        super-set is that of Incline bench press (for your upper chest) and incline push-ups (for your
                        lower chest).
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; Not only that, but the app also has an option for a shorter workout, which will ensure
                        you hit all the functionality in a slightly more aggressive manner including drop-sets,
                        tri-sets, giant-sets, etc.
                        <br />
                        The app also features an under 10 minute duration. In this section, time under tension is utilised
                        heavily. If you're trying to get a lift in in just 10 minutes, the only way to feel like
                        you've achieved anything is to keep the muscles under tension for as long as you can,
                        while still giving them just enough rest in between to recover so you can move on to other
                        functions or areas of the muscle. The app has a way of perfectly incorporating the right exercises for
                        this, using various techniques like 4 second eccentrics, isometrics, high time under tension, etc
                        to give you the best workout and leave you sore in just 10 minutes!

                        <br /><br /><br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; I made this game in the summer of 2018. It was my first time making a game working with
                        client code (Last paragraph is the most important).
                        The front end of the game was given and I had to create various classes and code the logic for the entire game.
                        The game is essentially a fight between two characters (and there are 4 different characters to choose from).
                        Each character has an attack ability and a special attack ability, each dealing different amounts of damage,
                        having a different effect on how the turns progress and requiring different amounts of sp. In
                        addition, each character has a unique defense which shields itself from attacks and each character has a different
                        special ability (ex: the Vampire heals itself by the amount it damages its opponent).
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; There is also an automatic playstyle where you can choose either one or both
                        players to play automatically.
                        There are different animations for when the players are attacking, special attacking, idle, etc.
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; In addition. there is a minimax playstyle that has been coded recursively and iteratively. (Both perform the same
                        function but the implementation is different). This is essentially a smart player that uses graph theory to evaluate all possible game states and picks the best possible move in every situation making it unbeatable.

                <div id="LED" ; class="description">

                    <p class="LEDDescription">
                        <br /><br /><br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; This project was made in C using an arduino and an LED light strip with separate ID's for each LED. The mic detects the sound and the arduino interprets the frequency and amplitude of the intensity of the sound and uses a function to convert those properties into lights of various colours and intensities.
                        <br />
                        There are two modes:
                        <br />
                        1) The light blinks to the beat of the music and the colour is determined by the frequency.
                        <br />
                        2) Different colours of light are propagated throughout the light strip in a wave like form and the length of the wave is determined by the beats of the sound.
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; To start, I considered the most simple version of the project: lighting the entire 500 pixel strip a color specific to the voltage output of the microphone. To convert between our input from the 0.2 to 2.1V input to a 256 RGB value, I used a disjoint sinusodial function. I settled on a disjoint sinusodial function as other functions either did not change the color of the LED strip enough to register a noticable effect, or didn't seem to create a constant blending with the music.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Making the Project Smarter</h3>
                    <p class="LEDDescription">
                        &emsp;&emsp; After making the dummy, it was time to make the light system smarter. I decided my system should react to music and thus the output light should be based on based on volume, variations in basal tones frequencies, and complexity (calculated by measuring the distance between peaks of sound graph).
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; To accomplish this, I deicided to turn to the book, "A Visual Guide to the Mathematics of Music" by Anthony Ashton. The book taught me about basic music theopry (which was supplemented by my 8 years of Violin experience), and how to interpret those musical elements as numbers. Using the book to convert the digital voltage output to more musically based subattributes (frequency, amplitude, and period), I started again with a data dump.
                        <br />
                        Then I implemented functions that relate:
                        • Frequency to color
                        • Beat to LED patch length
                        • Amplitude to brightness

                <div id="orbisChallenge" ; class="description">
                    <p id="orbisChallengeDescription">
                        &emsp;&emsp; The Orbis Challenge was a hackathon where we were given a game very similar to splix.io and we had to write a program the plays the game by reading and understanding their source code and implementing their API's. It was my first ever hackathon and my first ever project involving AI.
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; We were a team of 2 and we were both second year students. I was incharge of writing the logic for the game after the first algorithm (set of predetermined moves), which my teammate wrote, had been executed. After countless hours of debugging and trying to understand the source code and API's, we finally came up with the final version of our program. After that, we tried to implement machine learning into our algorithm to make it even smarter. Unfortunately we failed miserably as we had never had experience in that before and it was too much to learn for a 24 hour hackathon.
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; We were the only second years to place in the top 5! Each game started with a random selection of starting points for each team. This is the only game I could get my hands on that was played against other teams AI's (Their names have been hidden and switched to the colour).
                        <br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; Our algorithm was a mix between an agressive and a safe playstyle. In this game specifically, the opposing teams weren't playing very safe so our program played more agressive and therefore kept attacking their territory. As you can see, green and blue snakes are currently disabled because of our attacks. This also explains the huge gap on the bottom right of the board. Our program calculated a better chance of winning if it went towards the opponents and attacked them instead of playing safe.

                        &emsp;&emsp; In this hackathon we were the only team of 2 second year students up against professional teams so right off the bat we were just hoping to get through and try to not place last. To our surprise we managed to place in the top 10. We included features like:
                        • Automatically increasing or decreasin the amount of blue light coming out of the computer screen with the corresponding time of day since blue light disrupts your sleep cycle<br />
                        • Pause, resume, hold, merge, add, hang, record, stop record up call features<br />
                        • A catagory specific search bar<br />
                        • Number pad and the ability to make calls from the webapp itself<br />
                        &emsp;&emsp; This was my (and our) first time working with React and with javascript itself. It was challenging and the fact that JS is asynchronous didn't help. Still not sure how exactly the code worked but I'm just glad it did. Here's a video of what we managed to pull off in just under 24 hours.

Using it's onboard camera, which send data to a server for computation, it recognises and follows the person to the destination. An aggression algorithm is implemented that uses machine learning to detect the expression on individuals faces and if it detects aggression or danger, a loud siren is blown and a spotlight is activated that points to the suspect.
                        &emsp;&emsp;This was an arduino based project. For manual control, a bluetooth module is used and the drone is controlled from the laptop. A regular webcam was used along with a raspeberry pi for the computer vision part of the project. Since the computing power on the pi wasn't enough for this, we used a sim card module for the pi to provide it an internet connection to send the data to our server for processing.
