# This website was made during my first year of university. Please do not judge code quality based on this repo since I found it easier to just continue how I satrted it rather than refactoring the code.
# I have worked on various web apps as part of startups. It's not my strength but this is not the level of it for sure....
# Just wanted to put that out there since this is ugllllyyyyyyy.....
Only reason this is puiblic is so I can deploy directly from github.
